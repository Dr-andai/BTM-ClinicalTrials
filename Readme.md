This project explores text analysis on clinical trials in Kenya, Uganda, and Tanzania using two topic modeling methods:

BTM: A topic model that discovers topics from short texts by analyzing word co-occurrence patterns (biterms).
LDA: A probabilistic model that assumes each document is a mixture of topics, with each topic represented by a distribution of words.
